			<h2 class="welcome">Welcome to the amazing world of Yoga</h2>
	   		        <p>
		   		        I have been teaching yoga since 1979 having trained with the <a href="http://www.bwy.org.uk/">British Wheel of Yoga</a> and <a href="https://www.yogaalliance.org/">Friends of Yoga International</a>. It has been a real joy to teach people of all ages to a wide variety of groups. That is the amazing thing about Yoga &#45; it can be practised and enjoyed no matter what your age, background or ability.
		   		    
				        The word <b>Yoga</b> means Union &#40;yoke&#41; and is an ancient discipline.

		        <ul>
		            <li>Movement &#40;asana&#41;</li>
		            <li>Breath control &#40;pranayama&#41;</li>
		            <li>Concentration</li>
		            <li>Deep relaxation</li>
		        </ul>
			        <p>
				        With regular practice it brings suppleness, strength and stamina to the body. At the same time it concentrates, relaxes and stills the mind.
			        </p>
				    <p>
				        All you need is the will to give it a try, a small mat or rug to work on, and a little space to stretch...you will be amazed.

				<h2>Hatha Yoga</h2>
		            <p>
			            The practice of yoga is an art and science dedicated to creating union between body, mind and spirit. Its objective is to assist the practitioner in using the breath and body to nurture an awareness of ourselves intimately connected to the unified creation. It is about making balance within so as to live in peace, good health and harmony with the greater whole. This art of living was perfected and practiced in India thousands of years ago and the foundations of yoga philosophy were written down in The Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, approximately 200 AD. This sacred text describes the inner workings of the mind and provides an eight-step blueprint for controlling its restlessness so as to enjoying lasting inner peace.
		            </p>

			         <p>
				         The core of Patanjaliâ€™s Yoga Sutra is an eight-limbed path that forms the structural framework for yoga practice. Upon practicing all eight limbs of the path it becomes self-evident that no one element is elevated over another. Each is part of a whole which eventually brings completeness to the individual.  Because we are all uniquely individual a person can emphasize one branch and then move on to another as they round out their understanding.

            <h2>Health Benefits</h2>

		            <p>
			            Yoga's combined focus on mindfulness, breathing and physical movements brings health benefits with regular participation. Yoga participants report better sleep, increased energy levels and muscle tone, relief from muscle pain and stiffness, improved circulation and overall better general health. The breathing aspect of yoga can benefit heart rate and blood pressure.
			            Years of practice by millions of people have shown that yoga is the most amazing way to help keep both your body and mind healthy and happy.
